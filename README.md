QuestionBox:

QuestionBox is a social question and answer forum.  Users can log in, post questions, post answers to the questions of others, and mark questions and answers as "favorites."  

There is an API built in using Django Rest Framework.

At present, I am attempting to install Tastypie as an alternate API in order to increase knowledge of Tastypie.
